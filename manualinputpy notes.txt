Initially the car does not move when the program is started.
You can press X to end the program.

CONTROLS:

You can either press W or S to accelerate forward/backward
or A / D to steer left or right.
!!THE MOVEMENT/ACCELERATION IS TOGGLED!!

Steering left/right is instant (with 1 keypress), irrespective of current acceleration or steering.
When car is steering, accelerating in either direction is also instant.
When the car is stopped, the acceleration in either direction is instant. When the car is already accelerating forward/backward, pressing the "opposite" key stops the car, and pressing the key again makes it move the opposite direction.

Steering makes at least one of the wheels go forward at all times.
